# Deploying your app to Heroku - a step by step guide

Up until now, we have been working on our app and running it locally on our laptops. Whilst
this is useful for testing out our app during development, it's no good if our friends want to see
what we've done in this course!

In order for our friends to see the app, we need to upload (deploy) our code to Heroku, a cloud-based platform
which will assign a publicly accessible URL to our app that can then be visited!

Without further ado, let's go through how you can deploy your first app to Heroku!

0. Before your app can be deployed, there are some chores you need to do first:
   * Make a `Procfile` in the **root folder** of your application. This file contains the Command Prompt/Terminal command telling Heroku exactly how to start/run your application.
   It normally contains only the following line:
   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```
   Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your file containing your Flask code if you named it something different.
   In case you're curious: the `web:` part before the command tells Heroku to run your Python code as a web application.
   
   * Make a file named `requirements.txt` in the **root folder** of your application. This file lists all the external libraries
   (such as `Flask` and `tweepy`) required by your application, so that Heroku knows exactly the required libraries to install
   before trying to run your application.
   In this file, type in the libraries your application require line by line, which may look something like the following:
   ```
   flask
   requests
   python-dotenv
   tweepy
   ```
   
   * In `app.py` (or whatever you named your main file containing the Flask code), add the following line to the top
   of your Flask code:
   ```python
   import os
   ```
   For the curious: the `os` module is imported so that we can access *environment variables* set by Heroku, which includes the
   *port* it has assigned to run your application on.
   
   Next (usually near the bottom of your Flask code), replace
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True)
   ```
   with the following:
   ```python
   if 'PORT' in os.environ:
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ['PORT']))
   else:
        app.run(debug=True)
   ```
   Again, for the curious: this piece of conditional logic checks whether you are running your application on Heroku
   (in which case, the `PORT` environment variable would exist), or if you are running your application locally. The
   `host=0.0.0.0` bit instructs your Flask application to listen on **all** web address. This is important to ensure
   the application runs on Heroku since we don't know which host Heroku will decide to host the application on.

1. If you haven't already, go make a Heroku account at https://www.heroku.com

2. Once you have made a Heroku account, upon logging in, you will be taken to a dashboard, which looks something like the
following:

3. To deploy the app, we need to make one first on Heroku, so do that by clicking **New > Create New app** (button at top right of the
dashboard)

4. Type in the name of your application, and change the Runtime Selection to "Europe" - this is so that the application loads
faster as we are geographically closer to Europe than the United States. Finally, click "Create App".

5. After clicking "Create App", you should be greeted with the following screen:

![alt text](assets/heroku_config.png "App configuration screen")

6. Under "Deployment Method", change it to "GitHub". A "Connect to GitHub" section should now appear.

7. Under the "Connect to GitHub" section that just appeared, search for the GitHub repository corresponding to your project, then
click "Connect" to link the relevant repository (appeared as a result of the search) to the Heroku application you've just created.

8. To deploy your project, click "Deploy Branch" under "Manual deploy".

9. (Optional) You may have just noticed that a section named "Automatic deploys" has appeared in addition to the "Manual deploy"
section once you have connected your GitHub repository properly. To save you having to come back to this page in the future
and click "Deploy Branch" each time you pushed something new to your repository, if you click "Enable Automatic Deploys", then
Heroku will do so automatically.

Congratulations! You have now successfully deployed your application to Heroku!

# Adding new Python libraries to your app
When developing our apps locally, if you want to use a Python library like Flask in order to
start up a server controllable by you, the library needs to be installed first before we can use it by running
`pip install Flask` (or replace `Flask` with whatever library you need to install
in that command).

Luckily, you don't have to do that explicitly when the app is deployed onto
Heroku as the library installation process is all managed for us by Heroku.
To add a new library to your app, update the `requirements.txt` file by writing in the name
of the library on a new line, after the three libraries I've set up for you already in
the start point code.
