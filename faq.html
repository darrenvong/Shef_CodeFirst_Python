              Why do I get the following error when I tried to run my Python code

                Your terminal is probably <strong>not pointing at the right folder</strong>,
                where your Python file is saved.
              </p>
              <p>
                To fix that, work out which folder you saved your Python code at and change the
                folder the terminal is pointing at by typing <code>cd &lt;name_of_folder&gt;</code>,
                replacing <code>&lt;name_of_folder&gt;</code> with the actual name of the folder
                you saved your Python code at.

                You're most likely still running Python in <strong>interactive mode</strong>,
                which is <strong>a program on its own</strong> and as you can only run one
                program at a time in your terminal, you won't be able to run your Python file
                at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                To fix that, type <code>exit()</code> or <code>quit()</code> to get out of
                interactive mode first before trying to run your Python file again.

              <p>
                On Mac/Linux computers, Python is pre-installed into the operating system.
                As such, its version of Python (2.7) is found before the Python version you've
                downloaded.
              </p>
              <p>
                To run your code with Python 3.6 you've installed, try
                <code>python3.6 hello.py</code> instead of <code>python hello.py</code>.

              Try closing git bash first, open it again then run Python. If that

              <strong>Powershell</strong>, open that and run Python in it instead.
              If none of that works, speak to an instructor to make sure the python
              executable is properly registered to be used directly in the command line.

                They are both softwares for interacting with git, the version control system you
                will be using throughout this course to backup and work on code together.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Git bash</strong> allows you to interact with git through the
                Command Prompt/Powershell, whereas <strong>GitKraken</strong>
                allows you to do the same thing through a pretty and more friendly
                graphical user interface.

            <td>
              You don't need both software together, as GitKraken
              doesn't depend on git bash. <strong>We recommend you to use
                GitKraken</strong>, as that will be the software we use to cover how to do
              anything in class.

              Why do I get a permission denied error when I try to install a new library
              (<code>flask</code>, <code>requests</code>, <code>tweepy</code>)
              required by the course using <strong>pip</strong>?
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>
                <strong>Mac/Linux</strong>: This happens since Python is pre-installed
                into the operating system as mentioned before, which means any library code
                <strong>pip</strong> tries to install may end up in folders that require a
                higher permission level than the <strong>pip</strong> command has.
                It's a security mechanism to prevent rogue files being installed onto critical
                parts of your computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                To overcome the issue, if you haven't already, I recommend you install Python 3.6
                using the
                <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.8/python-3.6.8-macosx10.9.pkg"
                  target="_blank">Mac OS X installer here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're using a Linux-based OS... then try installing Python 3.6 by setting up
                <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv" target="_blank">pyenv</a> instead.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                <strong>Windows</strong>: Search for the <strong>Powershell</strong> or
                <strong>cmd</strong> in your start menu. Then, right click the result to start the
                shell as an <strong>administrator</strong> and try running the commands again. This
                is relatively safe since we are installing trusted libraries and Windows does not
                depend on Python like Mac/Linux computers do.

            </td>
            <td>
              They are both text-based user interface where you can get the computer
              to do something by typing in commands. The main difference is that Powershell
              is kind of the new Command Prompt, and uses commands more similar to the terminal
              on Mac/Linux computers. For that reason alone, I recommend using Powershell
              over the Command Prompt.

              <code>localhost</code> is the user friendly name for <code>127.0.0.1</code>.
              Our browser uses that to look up and translate back into the numeric web address
              (known as the IP address), which it then uses to reach our web app.

              Double check where you saved your HTML files: it needs to be inside the
              <strong>templates</strong> folder, otherwise Flask won't be able to find (and serve)
              them to back to your browser.

                Firstly, check that you have saved them inside the <strong>static</strong> folder,
                otherwise Flask won't be able to find and load them onto your page.
              </p>
              {% raw %}
              <p>
                The next thing to pay attention to is the <strong>spacing</strong> between the
                <code>{{ }}</code> used to output the location of the assets. There should be
                <strong>no spaces</strong> between the double curly braces/brackets.

                If that's not the problem, then check that you're using <strong>single quotes</strong>
                in the arguments of the <code>url_for</code> function call. This is important
                since using double quotes in the <code>url_for</code> function call arguments
                would close off the double quote we used for the <code>src</code> or
                <code>href</code> attribute in our HTML for including our assets.

                You most likely have defined functions <strong>with the same name</strong> twice
                or more! Since function names in the same Python file have to be unique, the error
                is telling you that you are replacing what you've written already, which is probably
                not what you want!

              <p>
                To fix this error, simply rename your functions so that they all have different names.

                You have probably tried to "visit" the app by double clicking the HTML file
                directly in File Explorer/Finder. This is <strong>not</strong> the right way to
                visit your app since your browser won't understand the additional template syntax
                that's not really part of HTML!
              </p>
              <p>
                The correct way to visit your app is by typing <code>localhost:5000/...</code>,
                as this ensures your template HTML will be run through the template engine which
                <strong>does</strong> know how to interpret the additional syntax and so will
                process and remove them before they are returned to the browser!
